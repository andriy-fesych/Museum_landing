Follow these steps to set up this project locally:<br/>
1. Clone the repo<br/>
git clone https://github.com/andriy-fesych/Museum_landing.git<br/>
2. This project was build on node version 14, but currently running on v20<br/>
If You are using node version 20+, skip step 3. Otherwise, to easily switch between node versions I recommend using NVM:<br/>
[Node Version Manager install guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)<br/>
Using this guide ☝️ choose NVM v1.1.12 [from here](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.1.12), as it is more stable<br/>
3. Now to use correct node version:<br/>
nvm install 20.19.0<br/>
nvm use 20.19.0<br/>
4. Install dependencies:<br/>
npm install<br/>
or<br/>
yarn install<br/>
5. Run the project locally:<br/>
npm start<br/>
or<br/>
yarn start<br/>
6. Congratulations! You are now set! 😊<br/>
